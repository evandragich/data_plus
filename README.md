# data_plus

This is an anonymized version of my summer 2021 Data+ project, Mapping Trajectories of Doctoral Students. Since the data is sensitive survey information, I have created an de-identified version, where programs have been replaced with the names of Pokemon.

Functionality-wise, all features remain the same; the changes from the original project are entirely cosmetic.

The project consists of a live Shiny App and a pair of files which use RMarkdown to automatically generate reports.

Check out the app here: https://evandragich.shinyapps.io/data_plus_project/

And browse one of the reports located in output/reports.

Thanks so much for checking out my repo, and feel free to contact me at evandragich@gmail.com with any questions!
